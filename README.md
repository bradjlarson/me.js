This is my personal javascript library.

It is simply an object with a number of my most commonly used/useful functions. Most of them I wrote myself, while a couple I borrowed from Stack Overflow or one of the javascript books I've read (probably Functional Javascript by Michael Fogus). 

Feel free to borrow/use/improve any of them. 

The library depends on Underscore and jQuery. A couple depend on Handlebars, which I use in my most of my projects.
